# MA1508E Linear Algebra for Engineering
## ma1508e repo
This is the repo for the tutorials, notes taken during my AY2425S2 MA1508E Linear Algebra for Engineering Course by Dr. Jonathon Teo.
The original course materials and programming is based on Matlab, but I rewrote the materials in Sympy for open-source accessibility.


Unless otherwise stated, Sympy should be the only dependency so far.
